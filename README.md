# CodeShareBox

CodeShareBox is a code snippet sharing application designed to make it easy for developers to quickly copy, paste, and share code snippets with others. It comes with robust security features, view restrictions, and time limitations, ensuring your code remains secure and under your control.

## Features

### Secure Code Sharing

CodeShareBox ensures the security of your code snippets. Share your code confidently with the peace of mind that it's only accessible to those you intend to share it with.

### View Restrictions

Set view restrictions on your code snippets. If you set a view limit of 3, the recipient can view the code only three times. This feature provides additional control over who can access your code.

### Time Restrictions

CodeShareBox allows you to set time restrictions on your code snippets. If you specify a time limit of 300 seconds, the code will be available for only 5 minutes, providing time-sensitive sharing options.

### Easy Sharing

Sharing code is effortless with CodeShareBox. From the homepage, you can easily create a code snippet, and with a single click on the "Submit" button, you'll receive a sharable link that works seamlessly across all major social media platforms.
